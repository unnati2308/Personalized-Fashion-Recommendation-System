# ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘– Personalized-Fashion-Recommendation-System
The Fashion Recommender System is a machine learning-based application designed to provide personalized fashion recommendations to users. By taking inputs such as name, age, type of clothing, and occasion, the system suggests a list of images that match the user's preferences. The system leverages a large dataset of fashion images, classifies them into different categories, and uses the MobileNet model (a Convolutional Neural Network) to find and recommend similar images. This tool is ideal for fashion enthusiasts, shoppers, and anyone looking for style inspiration.

## Features
- Personalized Recommendations: Provides fashion suggestions based on user inputs (e.g., clothing type, occasion).
- Image Classification: Uses a pre-trained MobileNet model to classify and analyze fashion images.
- Similarity Search: Finds and recommends images similar to the user's preferences.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive input/output system.
- Large Dataset: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset of fashion images for accurate recommendations.

## How It Works
### User Input:
The user provides inputs such as:
- Name
- Age
- Type of clothing (e.g., dress, shirt, jeans)
- Occasion (e.g., casual, formal, party)

### Image Classification:

- The system uses the MobileNet model to classify fashion images into different categories (e.g., dresses, shirts, jeans) based on the dataset.

### Similarity Search:

- Using the classified images, the system performs a similarity search to find images that match the user's preferences.

### Output:

- The system outputs a list of recommended images that align with the user's inputs.
